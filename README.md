# cord19-cdcs-nist

Curated Archive for COVID-19 Research Challenge Dataset
=======================================================

This GitHub repository contains a downloadable snapshot of National Institute of Standards and Technology's COVID-19 Data Repository (https://covid19-data.nist.gov) we curated from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) provided by the Allen Institute for AI (https://allenai.org) at https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research.

The COVID-19 Data Repository provides search CORD-19 data and metadata including full text extracted from the original CORD-19 JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform-neutral means for bulk downloads of curated COVID-19 data without overwhelming our COVID-19 Data Repository. We provide compressed tar archives using the GitHub release mechanism.

Additional descriptions and documentation can be found in the files of this repository.
